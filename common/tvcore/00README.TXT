This module implements the Ensigma common TV API and behaviour.

Eventually, we expect that this will be distributed within a TV support
library, but for now the source code is made available.

It is not intended that this module is changed in the course of a TV standard
development - indeed in a multi-standard system, this module will be shared
by all the standards in the system, so standard-specific changes must be avoided.

Any changes that *are* necessary - be they due to bugs or feature changes, MUST
be coordinated with the Ensigma tools group, who retain responsibility for this
module.
